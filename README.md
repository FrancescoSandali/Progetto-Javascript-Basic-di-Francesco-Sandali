😎ABOUT THE PROJECT  

My counter application simply provides the opportunity to add or remove numbers, and the display of these numbers is updated through a function that refreshes with each change in the number.

🔢HOW IT WORKS

There is a variable `count` that gets updated based on the button clicked. For example, if I click on +100, the `count` variable will increase its value by 100. Through a calculation logic, it will display the number on a screen. Additionally, there is a reset button that will set the `count` variable to 0.
